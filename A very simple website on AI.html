<p>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience (machine learning), recognizing patterns (pattern recognition), understanding natural language (natural language processing), and making decisions. AI can be categorized into two types: narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, such as voice recognition, and general AI, which can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a broad range of tasks. The goal of AI is not just to replicate human intelligence, but also to supplement it with speed, accuracy, and tirelessness. AI has a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to personalized recommendations in online shopping. However, it's important to note that while AI has made significant progress, it still has limitations and is a subject of ongoing research.
